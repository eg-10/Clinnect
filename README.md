OVERVIEW

Our project - “Clinnect” which stands for Clinic-Connect is an
app which helps users to find nearby hospitals, clinics and other
medical help around them, or any locality they wish to search. We
use a map view, which gives a proper idea of the address of the
medical help that the user seeks. We also provide the written
address.

We help the user to connect to the clinic/hospital by providing the
user with the phone number and website of that place, which they
can use to contact that place and book an appointment or simply
enquire. We also give the user an idea of what to expect from the
place by providing them with the Google rating, as well as our own
ratings which other users decide.

We let users bookmark places that they like. They can access the
contact of these places easily, without having to search for them
when needed.
